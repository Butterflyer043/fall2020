### 1) Check the data

* This should be obvious
* If your data is weak, your chart is weak
* Start with simple graphs to see if there are any outliers

* This is another obvious one
* Always include the source of your data
* Makes your graphic more reputable
* Allows for others to dig deeper

### 7) Consider your audience
