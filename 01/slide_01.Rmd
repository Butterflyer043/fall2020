* Data visualization is as valuable to anyone working with data as grammar is to anyone working with words
* Just as you should not write an essay without proper grammar, you should not create a graph without first mastering data visualization best practices

# Think about when you first get a dataset... what might happen?

--
- You don't know what to expect when you first open up a data file

--
- You make, remake and review summary charts to get a sense of what you are dealing with

--
- You throw the dataset into some kind of automatic tool for a quick overview

--
- You see something odd or interesting and you poke some more in that area

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Statistician John Tukey called this exploratory data analysis in his 1977 book of the same name. He opened with:

> Exploratory data analysis is detective work—numerical detective work—or counting detective work—or graphical detective work.

# You kind of know what you’re looking for, but you don’t know what you’re going to find yet. You work with your bag of tools through the available resources.

# You then present to your team...

# Oh no!

--
- Your labels are not aligned

--
- You have to tilt your head to see the data in the right way

--
- The chart type you have chosen is not ideal

--
- Your color choice is not color-blind friendly (and your boss is color blind)

--
- You used ComicSans font

--
- A variable is named _%$%#@!!_

--
- Your chart doesn't show properly on a mobile device and the CEO is looking at it from the beach
