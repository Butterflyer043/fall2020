1. Most data visualization has taken place in the last 30 years.
1. The first record of data vis dates back to 200 AD
1. Astronomical data presentation for navigation
1. 1700s: Rene Descartes
1. Create the first recorded sort-of 2D “graph” to perform math.
1. This type of graph was later used to present data.
1. 1800-1900: Graphs and pie charts (WilliamPlayfair)
1. 1913: Iowa State University: Introduced some of the first courses in “graphing” data 1. 1977: Princeton University:
1. Statistics Professor John Tukey
1. Developed the first exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.

  6) 1983: Edward Tufte published “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” which showed effective visualization methods.
7) 1984, Apple Computer introduced the first popular and affordable computer that focused in graphics (GIU) as a mode of interaction and display. This was huge and persists today.
8) 1999: The words, “information visualization” were so first named in the book: “Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think”, Card, Mackinlay, Shneiderman.
9) Around 2000ish - : In Few’s opinion, the IBM PC detracted from the value of making graphs by hand as it offers a mouse and computer-application based option. When people made graphs by hand, the took the time to be responsible.
