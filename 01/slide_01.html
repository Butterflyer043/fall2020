# Homework policies

- Homework assignments will be posted on the website by Wednesday following class. There will also be a submission link.
- Homework assignments submissions will be based on a R Markdown file and the corresponding HTML file, unless otherwise specified.
- Homework assignments are due back to me by the following Monday at midnight.
- You may be late on at most 1 homework out of the 4 homeworks that will be assigned.
- Homeworks will count for 50% of your grade.

### Collaboration

You are encouraged to collaborate either in person or through Slack, especially since there will be a fair amount of variability of R expertise in this class. However, your submitted work should be your own.


---

# Final Project

- A R Markdown dashboard using the `flexdashboard` package
- Use your own data
- Use R package(s) to visualize your data sets in at least 3 ways, to show what your data looks like and what your analytic results look like.
- Each student will be randomly assigned to 2 peers
  - Critiques based on quality and effectiveness of visualizations
- All final projects will be posted on the website, so we can learn from each other (unless you let me know first, for example, if the data is private and embargoed)
- I fully expect some of you to blow me away!!

This will count for 20% of your grade

---

# Class participation

- Come prepared for class
- Ask questions
- Comment on the strengths and weaknesses of visualizations when we work on them
- Discuss topics on the Slack channel

This will count for 30% of your grade

---

# Exemplar data

I don't work in bioinformatics anymore, or your particular disciplines. So:

- you can send me exemplar datasets by the night of the 3rd class (February 18), as well as telling me what you want to achieve
- I will try to incorporate common examples into the classes
- I will get you back completed visualizations or at least what I could achieve, on the last day of class.

---

# Software requirements

For this class you will need R and RStudio.

1. You can install R on your machine from https://cran.r-project.org. There are versions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. On windows machines, R can be installed without administrative privileges
1. You can install RStudio from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). If you have a Windows machine and do not have administrative privileges, you should download the version from the Zip/Tarballs section, open the zip file and just run RStudio.exe from there.

---

# Software requirements

For R, we will require the following packages:

1. `tidyverse` (a meta-package containing 8 other packages)
1. `flexdashboard` (the main reporting package)
1. `RColorBrewer` and `viridis` (color palettes)
1. `shiny` for some interactivity
1. `htmlwidgets`, `plotly`,`DataTables`, `highcharter` for dynamic plotting and reporting

&gt; On the website, there will be a file *packages.R*. This will have the R script to
install these packages. There will be instructions and (hopefully) a screencast up by Thursday

---

# Other useful software

1. Adobe Illustrator / Inkscape
1. Adobe Photoshop / GIMP
1. Adobe Reader Pro / Preview
1. ImageMagick (accessible via the R package `magick`)

# Evaluation

* Completion of weekly labs: 10%
* Weekly quizzes: 20%
* Problem Sets (3-4): 30%
* Group Project: 40%

???

Labs must be completed. They are not graded for correctness. You have to do them: quizzes have lab content, and the labs are an integral part of the hand-on learning. 

Quizzes are based on the readings, lectures and labs. Anything said in lecture is fair game. 

---

# Class Policies

- **Online Zoom Rules**
  - Participate and speak while on Zoom. We know it's harder to do classes over Zoom, but we love participation. Ask questions. Make comments. Challenge us. Acknowledge us. If we speak for three hours to a silent classroom, it is a lot more boring and tiring for everyone.
  - Focus your attention to the class. Online classes require higher level of engagement for everyone. Don't multitask (you know what we mean...)
  - Turn on your camera. If you have a bad hair day, that's ok (we do too.) We want to see you. If you have bandwidth issues and can't use your camera, we understand as well.
- **Course Communication:** Please use the provided **Canvas Discussion Boards** (separate than the ones from required class discussion) for questions about the course, homework assignments, technical issues, etc. Staff will be monitoring them and providing answers on a regular basis. Individual emails will not be answered except for special circumstances.
- **Due Dates:** Homework assignments are posted on Thursdays and will be due on the Friday a week after they are assigned, at the end of the day Eastern Time.  Due dates will not be extended.
- **Late Policy:** Late assignments or discussions will not be accepted and will get zero (0) points. Period. The two lowest assignment grades will be dropped. In lieu of a late policy this allows you to miss **up to two weekly assignments. This DOES NOT include discussions, portfolio or final project.**
- **Class materials are for class use only!:** Please refrain from making your private GitHub repositories or any other class materials public. A breach of this request is considered an Honor Code Violation.





---

# Class Policies (continued)

* **Due Dates:** due dates will not be extended, and late deliverables will incur a penalty of 25% per day. No excuses:
  * _It didn't work for me_
  * _I lost my code because I didn't push to github_ 
  * _It took me too long because it was the first time I'm doing it_ 
  * _It took too long to process_
  * _I ran out of credits_
* **Open Door Policy:** If you don't like something or something is not working for you, come and talk to us
* **Honor Code:** Follow the Honor Code. Collaboration policy in syllabus. Quizzes are individual. Code must be written individually and use your own cloud resources. Any deviation is considered a violation. **ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**
* **Class Materials:** For classroom use only. Please do not post publicly. Repositories must be maintained privately (for assignments, labs and project.)

# Think about when you first get a dataset... what might happen?

--
- You don't know what to expect when you first open up a data file

--
- You make, remake and review summary charts to get a sense of what you are dealing with

--
- You throw the dataset into some kind of automatic tool for a quick overview

--
- You see something odd or interesting and you poke some more in that area

# Exploratory Data Analysis

* Statistician John Tukey called this exploratory data analysis in his 1977 book of the same name. He opened with:

**Exploratory data analysis is detective work—numerical detective work—or counting detective work—or graphical detective work.**

# 

A reader who lands on your chart (and the underlying data) does not have the same luxury of developing and answering questions like you did. Some might know little about data or making sense of it. Some might know more, but they don’t want to analyze the dataset. They want to know the results.

With this in mind, let’s look over the main differences between you making charts for people to read versus you using charts for analysis.

# A [very] short history of data visualization

1. Most data visualization has taken place in the last 30 years.
1. The first record of data vis dates back to 200 AD
1. Astronomical data presentation for navigation
1. 1700s: Rene Descartes
1. Create the first recorded sort-of 2D “graph” to perform math.

1. 1913: Iowa State University: Introduced some of the first courses in “graphing” data 1. 1977: Princeton University:
1. Statistics Professor John Tukey
1. Developed the first exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.

  6) 1983: Edward Tufte published “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” which showed effective visualization methods.
7) 1984, Apple Computer introduced the first popular and affordable computer that focused in graphics (GIU) as a mode of interaction and display. This was huge and persists today.
8) 1999: The words, “information visualization” were so first named in the book: “Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think”, Card, Mackinlay, Shneiderman.
9) Around 2000ish - : In Few’s opinion, the IBM PC detracted from the value of making graphs by hand as it offers a mouse and computer-application based option. When people made graphs by hand, the took the time to be responsible.

You kind of know what you’re looking for, but you don’t know what you’re going to find yet. You work with your bag of tools through the available resources.
That’s when it’s just you. If labels are not aligned, or you have to tilt your head to see the data in the right way, or the chart type isn’t ideal, who cares? You know what you’re looking at or can make another chart to change the view so that you do.

# How to think about datavis

- Begin with the consumer in mind
- You have a deep understaing of the data you are presenting
- The audience that sees your visualizations may not
- Make sure the graphic is clear
- Makre sure the main point you want to make pops

---

# Why visualize data?

- To communicate a story
- To see what's in the data

---

# What are some ways a visualization can be useful?

- Does it help you spot trends?
- Does it help you explore?
- Does it tell a story?


---

# Why is this important?

Data have dimensions
Visualizations have dimensions, too
To build visualizations, we need to map data dimensions to visual dimensions


# Numbers don't tell the whole story

anscombe and dinosair

# Summaries don't differentiate

---

# How do we get from Data to Visualization?

Need to understand
- the properties of the data or information
- the properties of the image
- the rules mapping data to images

.footnote[The Statistical Atlas of the United States, produced in the late 1800s]

???

When you don’t know if people can read your chart, explain all of the encodings. What scale are you using? What does that color represent? Is this normal?

It’s better to err on the side of too much explanation than it is too little. At least with the former, people can gloss over the details if they’re already familiar. They can still read the chart. With the latter, people who are unfamiliar with the visual encodings will get stuck.

Rewind a couple of centuries when charts were less common. The Statistical Atlas of the United States, produced in the late 1800s by the Census Bureau, explained all of the encodings. For example, look at this bump chart from the 1880 atlas. It ranks cities by population:
