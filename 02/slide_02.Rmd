## Last week

Designing for an audience vs. designing for you

.pull-left[
**Tufte**
1. Show data variation, not design variation
1. Do not use graphics to quote data out of context
1. Use clear, detailed, thorough labelling.
1. Representation of numbers should be directly proportional to numerical quantities
1. Don't use more dimensions than the data require
]


.pull-right[
**Nathan Yau**
1. Check the data
1. Explain encodings
1. Label axes
1. Include units
1. Keep your geometry in check
1. Include your sources
1. Consider your audience
]
